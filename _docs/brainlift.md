# Game Week Project - Complete Summary

## Project Overview

This document summarizes our comprehensive planning and development process for your "Game Week Project" - a polished, multiplayer game built in one week using an unfamiliar tech stack to demonstrate rapid, AI-assisted learning.

## Project Goal and Initial Concept

**Original Challenge**: Build a polished, multiplayer game in one week using an unfamiliar tech stack to demonstrate rapid, AI-assisted learning.

**Initial Analysis**: We compared a Hearthstone-like CCG with an Age of Wonders-like strategy game and concluded that a 1v1 card game was a much better fit for the project's timeline and scope.

## Game Concept: "Tavern Draft" Auto-Battler

We refined the initial card game idea into a "Tavern Draft" auto-battler, chosen for its inherently multiplayer experience with a tight, repeatable game loop achievable within one week.

### Core Gameplay Loop
- **1v1 Gameplay**: Keeps the networking scope manageable
- **Tavern Draft Phase**: Players use gold to buy minions from a shared, rotating shop
- **Auto-Combat Phase**: Players' parties of minions automatically fight each other according to simple, deterministic rules

### Additional Features
- **Practice Mode**: Single-player mode planned for polish phase to enhance evaluation without compromising multiplayer-first development

## Technical Architecture and Tech Stack

### Engine Selection
**Godot** was selected as the ideal engine due to:
- Beginner-friendly nature
- Simplicity of GDScript
- Robust built-in tools for UI and networking
- Mature AI assistance available for development

### Architecture Decision
**Client-Hosted Server Model**: Provides authoritative server to prevent cheating and ensure game state consistency without the complexity of a dedicated server application.

### Development Workflow
**AI-Assisted Side-by-Side Workflow**: Using Godot IDE for coding and debugging while leveraging AI assistant for:
- Generating code snippets
- Explaining concepts
- Debugging errors

## Gameplay Mechanics and Data Structures

### Strategic Depth Through Tribal Synergies
Core strategy built around three tribal types with distinct mechanical identities:

1. **Beasts**: Focus on dynamic, in-combat stat growth
2. **Mechs**: Focus on sharing keywords like "Taunt" across the team
3. **Demons**: Focus on high-risk, high-reward mechanics

### Technical Architecture
**Component-Based Architecture**: Each minion's data points to separate ability scripts, maintaining clean, modular, and scalable code structure.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: UI and Core Interaction

**UI Construction**:
- Built initial UI with game board, hand area for cards (`PlayerHand`), and "End Turn" button
- Implemented Godot's layout system (`HBoxContainer`, `PanelContainer`, anchors, size flags)

**Dynamic Card Creation**:
- System to dynamically instance card scenes from code
- Used `preload` constant for card scene and functions to add new cards to hand

**Data-Driven Design**:
- Separated card data (name, description, stats) from visual representation
- Created central `CARD_DATABASE` dictionary as "source of truth" for all possible cards

**Drag-and-Drop System**:
- Implemented robust drag-and-drop for cards
- Refined through multiple iterations for smooth tracking and global input handling

### Phase 2: Combat and Game Logic

**Game Concept Refinement**:
- Pivoted from generic card game to "minions-only" auto-battler
- **Critical Architectural Decision**: Distinguished between:
  - **CardData**: Raw blueprint in database
  - **Game Piece**: Visual `card.tscn` representing that data

**Combat Simulation**:
- Designed automated combat phase
- Primary output: **Combat Log** (not visual animation initially)

**Combat Log System**:
- Generates detailed, turn-by-turn log of every action (attacks, damage, deaths)
- Enables multiplayer replay system where each client uses log for identical animation playback

**Round-Robin Combat Logic**:
- Corrected combat logic for proper "round-robin" sequence
- Minions attack in turns from left to right rather than leftmost minion attacking repeatedly

## Current Development Status

### Completed Foundation
- Existing Godot test project provides excellent starting point with:
  - Core networking capabilities
  - Data-driven design foundation
  - Functional drag-and-drop system

### Implementation Plans Created
1. **Phase 1 Plan**: Building initial "Tavern" UI system
2. **Phase 2 Plan**: Creating backend "Combat Log" generator

### Ready for Development
- Comprehensive step-by-step implementation plan prepared
- Focus on evolving existing project's data structures to fit new minion-centric design
- Clear path from prototype to polished multiplayer experience

## Key Architectural Decisions Summary

1. **Technology**: Godot + GDScript for rapid development
2. **Networking**: Client-hosted server model
3. **Game Type**: Auto-battler for manageable scope
4. **Data Architecture**: Component-based minion abilities
5. **Combat System**: Deterministic round-robin with detailed logging
6. **UI Design**: Dynamic, data-driven card management
7. **Development Approach**: AI-assisted iterative development

This foundation provides a clear roadmap for creating a polished, multiplayer auto-battler game within the one-week timeline while demonstrating effective use of AI assistance in rapid game development.
